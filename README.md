# Snuffle

Basically Tinder for Adopting Dogs - Snuffle is an app that matches you with a "doggo" in need of re-homing. A user creates a profile and fills out a basic questionnaire. The user is then shown dogs (list scraped from craigslist) and they can swipe right or left if they like or dislike the dog's image. If they swipe right and the dog's personality matches the user's preferences, they are "matched" and the owner is given the ability to contact the current owner.
